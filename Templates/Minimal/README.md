# Minimal Template
This template has only a small amount of code for a simple bot
## Setup:
Go to the [Discord Develeper Portal]("https://discord.com/developers/applications") and create an application, open it and create a bot, paste the bot token into the "TOKEN" value in the first lines of the template, make sure that you have the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) module installed, and run the script.
Get the bot invite link by opening the OAuth2 panel in the [Discord Develeper Portal]("https://discord.com/developers/applications"), only select scope "bot", and the "Send Messages" permission, and any others that you need. Open it to invite the bot to a server that you manage. It works if it prints "Ready!". The bot won't do anything until you add your code!
